Bluetooth stuff
===============

- Handly BLE tutorial (from the perspective of someone creating a new
  BLE hardware device, but still useful):

- LightBlue iOS app.  Handy for simulating BLE Peripherals or Centrals:

- CoreBluetooth iOS 7 documentation:

- Texas Instruments bluetooth wiki, including some examples (not sure
  this is directly helpful; it seems to focus on the TI BT sensors,
  but there might be some useful nuggets in here...?).

iOS / XCode stuff
=================

- WWDC 2013 videos.  One good one is "From Zero to App Store in XCode
  5" -- can download the PDF and the videos (can only watch the video
  inline in Safari):

  https://developer.apple.com/wwdc/videos/index.php?id=403

  CoreBluetooth is another good one:

  https://developer.apple.com/wwdc/videos/index.php?id=703

  --> Note: downloading and viewing the PDF doesn't make much sense
      without first watching the video (i.e., the slides are very
      sparse in terms of explanations; the words the guy says are
      quite important to understand the slides).
