Next meeting dates:

        progress
- Dec 7:  
- Dec 14: 
- Dec 21: 
- Dec 28: Jeff unavailable

-----------------------------

Homework for next time:
- Cash register
  *Expands on cash register program
  *Enter starting cash, print ending cash in register, etc.
  *Allow entering tax rate (ask this once at startup)
  *Allow for entry of multiple items in a single order
  *Enter a description of each item
  *When no more items to enter, print a list of all item descriptions
      and prices in this order
      --> Use STL vector<...> to save stuff.
  *Print subtotal, tax, and total (i.e., subtotal + tax)
  *Allow canceling of an order
  Allow a gift message with the order
      --> Suggestion: use struct item, and also a struct order (for
          the entire order, including gift message)

- Synthesize notes on text/word and push it to Git

- Find news articles about bluetooth low energy

- Get hcitool lescan to detect my iPhone

- The thread about lescan etc.
	- https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/pandaboard/6Kf9V6KcXsw

-----------------------------

Requirements for science project:

- Go lookup which 3 science fairs are possible
  Look up the requirements (and dates!) for each
  Start deciding which two to target
  --> Probably have a PPT and/or a research paper

- Requirement for class: ?5-10? minute PPT presentation
  --> Jeff will definitely have opinions and be able to critique your
      PPT slides and presentations
  --> Luke to find out when this will be; find out before Christmas
      break

- What do we need to be collecting along the way for what you need to
  turn in?
  --> Start bringing notebook, we will be writing in it, and
      signing+dating every page every time

- Scientific method (i.e., science vs. just hacking around)
  Ask a question 
  ---> Can I detect nearby bluetooth devices from my Raspberry Pi? If so, how?
  Background research
    - ssh to the RPi
    - using Terminal and a command line
    - Networking
	- IPv4 addresses
      	  - how they work
	  - their role on a local and global scale
        - NAT - network address translation
	- Routers on a global scale
	- Multi-step routing
	  - No global knowledge, just the next step
	- Private IP Address Ranges
          - 192.168.x.y
	  - 10.x.y.z
	  - 172.16.x.y
	- Loopback IP Address
	  - 127.x.y.z - only for the same computer (
    - C++ STL vectors
	- methods of using them
	- syntax
  Make a hypothesis
  Conduct experiments
  Analyze results
  Communicate results

- Logbook

------------------------
Bluetooth Experiments
- Run hciconfig hci0 piscan to make the RPi discoverable
	- Did not show up on the iPhones, but did show up on the Macs
	- iPhones appear to filter bluetooth devices
- On RPi, run hciconfig hci0 name [name] to name the device
- Bluetooth - setup new device
	- Select [name] and hit continue on the computer
	- It will show "Pairing Failed" and give you a pin
	- Run bluetooth-agent [pin] on the RPi
	- Hit continue on the computer to try to pair again
	- Enter any random password, hit enter, and pairing is complete
- hcidump -X is a bluetooth sniffer - outputs all of the commands and replies to the bluetooth 
  device
	- run two terminals, one with hcidump -X and one with the bluetooth commands
- If the bluetooth starts acting weird, do a hciconfig hci0 down and then up
