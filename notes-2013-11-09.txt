Random notes:
-------------

We determined that we can see iPhone devices with the "hcitool scan"
command, but only if our iPhone 5's are in pairing mode.  The RPi
seems to "remember" the device for a while, and then forget about it
-- suggesting that it is caching scan data for a while, and then
discarding the cache data (at which point you need to do a new scan).

The RPi adapter device name for the BT nub is "hci0" (i.e., the first
HCI device that Linux found).

The iPhone BT devices have MAC addresses, just like wifi/Ethernet
devices.  If you go into iPhone config->general, both the BT and Wifi
MAC addresses are visible.  When you hcitool scan, you'll see the same
iPhone MAC addresses from the RPi.

Next steps:
-----------

Figure out how to use the bluez/hcitools command to pair the RPi with
the iPhone.

Can the iPhone be paired with more than one device simultaneously?

Can the RPi be paired with more than one device simultaneously?

How far away can the iPhone be for the RPi to see it?
